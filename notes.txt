The goal is to take a repository of PHP code, parse them into syntax trees, and then create a flow graph.

Input: PHP source code organized into files

1: parse each file into a syntax tree ( the original code still needs to be stored with the tree to extract names )

Objects needed: File (owns source code, tree, and resolved cursors)
			source code
			parsed tree
			resolved objects
		Taint (name and scope of tainted object)
			kind
			name
			scope
		Analyzer (keeps a list of taints, and pushes tainted vertices to the graph)
		Graph (flow graph of the plugin)
		

Output: Flow Graph
